  First stable version. Provides version number on launch.

	* add.c: Created ver() function to display version numbers.

	Created new_space() function to clarify code.

	Created pname() function to print name of program.

	* add.c (main): Now uses pname(), new_space(), and ver()

	space inbetween. This occurs before license is printed.

  Getting closer to stable version API. New minor version.

	* add.c: Removed the VER constant and replaced it with
  the MAJOR_VER, MINOR_VER, PATCH_VER, ALPHA_VER, BETA_VER,
  and RC_VER in response to the fact that it was difficult
  to print a version scheme with multiple periods.
  Defined MINOR_VER as 9 while everything else is 0.

  Re-commented everything after a file corruption resulted
  in the loss of all comments for the previous version
  (0.8.0).
